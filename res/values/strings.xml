    <string name="about_text"><b>Description:</b>    The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a 
    cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician 
    John Horton Conway in 1970.
    \n\nThe "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution
    is determined by its initial state, requiring no further
    input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an
    initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
    \n\n<b>Rules:</b>    The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional
    orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two
    possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its
    eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
    vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the
    following transitions occur:
    \n\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
    \n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.
    \n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
    \n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a
    live cell.
    \n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The
    first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously
    to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and
    the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick
    (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding
    one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further
    generations.
